I have recently become interested in the Ryobi line of tools that are based on
their 18V battery packs. There is a wide line of useful handheld tools offered
including drills, hot glue guns, flashlights and more. These are great for use
around the home, portable at a campsite and during a power outage. Ryobi also
offers power stations for USB charging and even 120VAC output. The utility of
this unified framework of tools and batteries has a lot of benefits. A common
battery platform allows the tools to be offered at a much lower price.

Given how readily available and affordable these batteries can be, I am
interested in using them to power gadgets outside of the choices that Ryobi
offers.
