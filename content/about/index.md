My name is Andrew Rossignol and I am a Staff Software Engineer at Google.

## Hobbies

I have too many hobbies. I enjoy spending time tinkering with vintage audio,
lithium batteries, electric vehicles, 3D printing, electronics, embedded software,
Linux servers, and more.

As a creative outlet, I maintain a blog called [TheResistorNetwork](http://theresistornetwork.com)
and companion [YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/c/TheResistorNetwork).
When I decide that a project is large or interesting enough to warrant a blog
post, I will post over there. This website captures smaller projects, one-liners,
photos of interesting projects and more.

## Career

I have held a number of jobs over the years. Most of those jobs have been
technical or engineering-related but I have also had some opportunities to
work with my hands and coordinate youth activities over the years.

I love working with technology and am a generalist. I have worked on everything
from embedded systems to business automation web applications and everything
in between.

### Google

I have been working for Google since June 2014 and have contributed to a number
of exciting projects since then.

#### Jamboard

In June 2014 I joined Google and worked on Jamboard out of the New York City
office. I worked on integration of touch drivers with Android, working with
the `uinput` interface. I also worked heavily with OpenGL and found numerous
opportunities for performance optimizations in the rendering stack.

I developed the first integration with Google's video conferencing solution
known as GVC. This was a self-motivated weekend hackathon and later went on
to become a core feature of the product.

#### Android

In October 2015 I moved to Mountain View, CA and joined the Android team. I
accepted this role to apply my experience with embedded systems to the sensor
hubs of mobile phones. I was on the team for Nexus 5X/6P and Pixel 1 through 4.
I also launched two watches and developed functionality that reduced screen-on
power consumption by a factor of 10. This was adopted by other vendors.

As part of the sensor hub project, a new platform known as Context Hub was
designed to standardize the APIs available to algorithms running on low-power
sensor processors.

#### Tidal

In February 2019, I moved to Google X to work on a project known as Tidal. On
this team, I became the Tech Lead Manager of the System Software team. This
team is responsible for a variety of functionality including device firmware,
factory test software, web control/montoring, application scheduling, working
with image sensors and more.

One of my more prominent contributions was a complete realtime firmware solution
responsible for power monitoring, sensor readout and realime control over motors
and lights attached to the system.

#### gChips

In December of 2021, I decided to leave Tidal to spend more time working closely
with embedded systems and accepted a role as lead of the Image Signal Processor
Silicon Validation (ISP SiVal) team. This team is responsible for validating
the design of the ISP used in the Tensor SoC. This covers a large body of work
including part characterization, pre-silicon emulation and working with hardened
complex algorithms to validate their correctness and performance.

The charter has grown to become the Multimedia Silicon Validation (MM SiVal)
team which includes Codecs, Camera, TPU and Display subsystems.

### L-3 WESCAM

Prior to Google I worked for L-3 Wescam in Burlington, Ontario. I was hired as
a manufacturing engineering student to develop electrical test fixtures for
the ETAD (Eelectrical Test Automation Development) group. Within a few weeks
I demonstrated my software capabiltiies and was dedicated to design a new
Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to digitize documents used while building
camera systems on the production line.

This effort was a massive success, was deployed company-wide and resulted in
huge financial savings for the company.

Once MES was feature complete, I turned my attention to a number of other
business applications including Shipment Management System (SMS) to manage the
shipping/receiving dock and AssetTracker to track tool calibration on the
production line.
