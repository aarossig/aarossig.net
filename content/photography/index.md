I am interested in (photo|video)graphy. I am often more of a gear nerd than an
accomplished photographer. Either way, I enjoy the hobby and craft of capturing
moments.

## Background

I have worked with imaging sensors for a good deal of my career both in a
professional and hobby capacity. Back in 2014, I wrote a [driver](http://www.theresistornetwork.com/2014/11/flir-lepton-thermal-imaging-sensor.html)
for the first Flir Lepton thermal imaging sensor. I developed underwater imaging
imaging solutions at Google X for 3 years from early 2019 to late 2021. Since
early 2022, I lead the Multimedia Silicon Validation team which
includes the ISP (image signal processor).

## Showcase

Here are a few highlights of different types of photos.

I enjoy the challenge and adventure that comes with astrophotography. I am not
nearly an expert, but it is very rewarding to capture the stars and develop
the photos to highlight the detail of the night sky.
