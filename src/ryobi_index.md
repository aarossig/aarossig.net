## Ryobi Tools/Batteries

I have recently become interested in the Ryobi line of tools that are based on
their 18V battery packs. There is a wide line of useful handheld tools offered
including drills, hot glue guns, flashlights and more. These are great for use
around the home, portable at a campsite and during a power outage. In addition
to these tools, Ryobi offers power source devices that offer USB charging and
even 120VAC output. The utility of this unified framework of tools and batteries
has a lot of benefits. A common battery platform allows the tools to be offered
at a much lower price.<br>

### DIY Accessories

Given how readily available and affordable these batteries can be, I am
interested in using them to power gadgets outside of the choices that Ryobi
offers. Each of these has a separate page.

### Dummy Battery

To support power measurements of some of the accessories, I decided to make a
dummy battery. This was recycled from a P107 battery with dead cells. I stripped
down the internal components to allow space for wires to route up to the main
connector. I drilled a hole in the side and used a grommet to pass the wires
through the case.

### Repairs

Ryobi batteries of varying age can often be found for sale on eBay in large
groups or "lots". I purchased a lot of 10 P107 batteries with the sole intent
of salvaging one to build a dummy battery. I was pleasantly surprised to find
that of the 10, two could also be salvaged and have good battery health.
