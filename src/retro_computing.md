## Retro Computing

These are some notes from my retro computing setup. I became interested in
running operating systems that were popular in my childhood on modern
hardware and decided to see if I could replicate the experience with QEMU and
other tools like DOSBox.

### Operating Systems

The links here provide details about different operating systems that I have
experimented with.

* [Windows 9x](retro_computing_windows_9x.html)

### Hardware Setup

The setup that I use is a custom-built system that is based on an Intel Atom
processor. The styling from the early 1990s aside from the more modern
monitor.

I produced a [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llYAggVQgf4)
about this setup and a photo is below.
