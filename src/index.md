## Home

Welcome to aarossig.net. This is my personal homepage where I share a little
about myself, document projects and aggregate links to my other online presence.

I have too many hobbies: photography, electronics, cooking, music, vintage audio,
3D printing, blogging, video editing and more. This website aims to document a
few of them.<br>
