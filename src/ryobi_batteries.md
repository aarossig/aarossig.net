## Ryobi Batteries

I have recently become interested in the Ryobi line of tools that are based on
the 18V battery packs. There is a wide line of useful handheld tools offered
including drills, hot glue guns, flashlights and more. These are great for use
around the home, portable at a campsite and during a power outage. In addition
to these tools, Ryobi offers power source devices that offer USB charging and
even 120VAC output. The utility of this unified framework of tools and batteries
has a lot of benefits. A common battery platform allows the tools to be offered
at a much lower price.
